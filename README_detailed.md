# Sewerage Depth Estimator

A QGIS plugin designed to optimize sewerage system design by providing real-time depth estimation and automated network calculations during the design process.

## Overview

This plugin serves as a comprehensive tool for sewerage system design, developed to work seamlessly alongside the **SaniHUB RedBasica** plugin ([GitHub Repository](https://github.com/EL-BID/red_basica)). It addresses critical challenges in sewerage network design by automating depth calculations and providing intelligent network analysis capabilities.

## Key Features

### üîÑ Real-Time Depth Estimation
- **On-the-fly calculations**: Estimates segment depths automatically as you design
- **Dynamic updates**: Continuously recalculates depths based on design parameters
- **Visual feedback**: Provides immediate visual indication of depth values

### üåä Intelligent Network Analysis
- **Downstream cascade calculations**: Automatically recalculates the entire downstream network when new segments are added to upstream sections
- **Smart connectivity detection**: Analyzes network topology to ensure proper flow calculations
- **Tree-based algorithms**: Uses advanced algorithms for efficient network traversal and calculation

### ‚ö° Automated Recalculation
- **Edit-triggered updates**: Automatically recalculates affected segments when existing segments are modified
- **Selective processing**: Only recalculates necessary portions of the network for optimal performance
- **Change management**: Tracks and manages design modifications intelligently

### üéõÔ∏è Design Optimization
- **Parameter-driven design**: Uses configurable parameters (minimum cover, diameter, slope, initial depth)
- **DEM integration**: Incorporates Digital Elevation Models for accurate terrain-based calculations
- **Style management**: Provides standardized styling for better visualization

## Benefits

### Time Efficiency
- **Reduces design time** by automating complex calculations that would otherwise require manual computation
- **Eliminates iterative processes** that are common in conventional design workflows
- **Provides immediate feedback** on design decisions

### Design Quality
- **Optimized layouts**: Enables achievement of depth-optimized sewerage systems
- **Consistency**: Ensures uniform calculation standards across the entire network
- **Accuracy**: Reduces human error in complex hydraulic calculations

### Process Integration
- **Seamless workflow**: Integrates naturally with existing QGIS-based design processes
- **Compatibility**: Works alongside other sewerage design tools and plugins
- **Flexible parameters**: Adapts to different design standards and requirements

## Target Users

- **Civil Engineers** specializing in water and wastewater infrastructure
- **Urban Planners** working on municipal infrastructure projects
- **Design Consultants** involved in sewerage system projects
- **Municipal Engineers** responsible for infrastructure development
- **Students and Researchers** in environmental and civil engineering

## Technical Requirements

- **QGIS 3.x** (Latest version recommended)
- **Python 3.x** environment
- **PyQt5** libraries
- Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS

## Companion Tools

This plugin is designed to complement:
- **[SaniHUB RedBasica](https://github.com/EL-BID/red_basica)**: Primary sewerage network design tool
- Standard QGIS vector editing tools
- Digital Elevation Model (DEM) processing tools

## Why This Plugin?

Traditional sewerage design processes often involve:
- **Time-consuming manual calculations**
- **Iterative trial-and-error approaches**
- **Limited optimization due to time constraints**
- **Difficulty in maintaining network consistency**

This plugin addresses these challenges by:
- **Automating complex calculations**
- **Providing real-time optimization feedback**
- **Enabling comprehensive network analysis**
- **Maintaining design consistency across large projects**

## Getting Started

1. **Install** the plugin through the QGIS Plugin Manager
2. **Load your sewerage network** layers (line features)
3. **Configure design parameters** (cover depth, diameter, slope)
4. **Load a DEM layer** for elevation data
5. **Start designing** - the plugin will automatically calculate depths as you work

## Support and Contribution

This plugin is actively developed to support the sewerage design community. For issues, suggestions, or contributions, please refer to the project documentation and issue tracking system.
